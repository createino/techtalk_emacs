* Emacs vs the World
  - Emacs vs vim
    Emacs pros:
    - it has better default extension language.
    - it's modeless.
    - it has better integration with external systems.
    - it has better support for the things that matter to me. [fn:4]
    - it has a built-in package manager.
    Vim pros:
    - nicer navigation
    - much smaller core and much faster to load
    - very simple initial config
    - it has a more stylish icon than Emacs :)
  - Emacs vs IDEs
    IDEs pros:
    - good refactoring support
    - semantic code analysis
    - integrated GUI debuggers and GUI design tools
    - precise auto-completions
    - good integration with external systems, i.e. version control
    IDEs cons:
    - dependent to the mouse and an X environment
    - not resource efficient
    - IDEs impair your thinking by thinking instead of you

Bagaimana pun juga, apa pun editor Anda, selama Anda merasa produktif
dan efisien, then it's good...
