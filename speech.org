* Emacs at a Glance
** Define
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   GNU Emacs is an *extensible*, *customizable* text editorâ€”and
   more. At its core is an interpreter for Emacs Lisp, a dialect of
   the Lisp programming language with extensions to support text
   editing. [fn:1]
   #+END_QUOTE

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   Emacs is not an extensible text-editor. It's a programming
   environment with a nice built-in library for editing text. [fn:2]

* Emacs vs the World
  - IDE and Code Editors Stats 2014 [fn:9]
    [[./img/editors_stats.jpg]]

  - Emacs vs vim

    Emacs pros:
    - it has better default extension language.
    - it's modeless.
    - it has better integration with external systems.
    - it has better support for the things that matter to me. [fn:10]
    - it has a built-in package manager.

    Vim pros:
    - nicer navigation
    - much smaller core and much faster to load
    - very simple initial config
    - it has a more stylish icon than Emacs :)
  - Emacs vs IDEs

    IDEs pros:
    - good refactoring support
    - semantic code analysis
    - integrated GUI debuggers and GUI design tools
    - precise auto-completions
    - good integration with external systems, i.e. version control

    IDEs cons:
    - dependent to the mouse and an X environment
    - not resource efficient
    - IDEs impair your thinking by thinking instead of you
* Problems
  - No adequate embedded browser in Emacs!
  - Still have to learn Lisp to extend Emacs more
* Getting Started with Emacs
  [[./demo/emacs_learning_curve.jpg][img]]

  It +only+ takes 2 steps:
  1. run the built-in Emacs tutorial ~C-h t~.
  2. use Emacs day and night for all your work or even use it as
     your window manager. [fn:11]
* Conclusion
  - *However, whatever your editor choice is, as long as you feel
    efficient and productive, then it's good...*
  - *Lastly, you are not picking Emacs vs others, but rather you are
    picking Emacs and others! Use the best tool for the job.*
