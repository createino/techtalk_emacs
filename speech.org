* Emacs vs the World
  - Emacs vs vim

    Emacs pros:
    - it has better default extension language.
    - it's modeless.
    - it has better integration with external systems.
    - it has better support for the things that matter to me. [fn:4]
    - it has a built-in package manager.

    Vim pros:
    - nicer navigation
    - much smaller core and much faster to load
    - very simple initial config
    - it has a more stylish icon than Emacs :)
  - Emacs vs IDEs

    IDEs pros:
    - good refactoring support
    - semantic code analysis
    - integrated GUI debuggers and GUI design tools
    - precise auto-completions
    - good integration with external systems, i.e. version control

    IDEs cons:
    - dependent to the mouse and an X environment
    - not resource efficient
    - IDEs impair your thinking by thinking instead of you


* Getting Started with Emacs
  It takes (only) 2 steps:
  1. run the built-in Emacs tutorial ~C-h t~
  2. use Emacs day and night for all your work

* Note!
  - *Bagaimana pun juga, apa pun editor Anda, selama Anda merasa
    produktif dan efisien, then it's good...*
  - *Remember, this, of course, is _highly subjective_ :)*
